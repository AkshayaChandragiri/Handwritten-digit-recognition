Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN
Project Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset is used to accurately recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from images.

The system focuses on correct preprocessing, ensuring that real handwritten images are converted into MNIST-like format before prediction.
